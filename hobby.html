            Sports Medicine/Athletic Training

        <h5 class = "body">
            Sports medicine is the study of the body, used for the rehab and treatment of athletes. I do this as an extracuricular at school, and is what I want to major in during college. I enjoy it because I love sports and want to go into the medical feild. We go to practices, athletic events, and help with rehab in the training room.

            Painting
        </h3>
        <h5 class = "body">
            Painting is, well, painting. It's an artform that I've been doing since I was a little girl! I enjoy panting because it allows me to express myself and make something beatiful. There is endless posibilities when it comes to painting. I use acrylic paint to paint on canvas's; I like to paint album covers the most. You can mix paint, uses different colors, or even mix mediums to make what you want.

            Music 
        </h3>
        <h5 class = "body">
            I enjoy listening and making music. I listen to all types of music, ranging from country to RnB, every single day. I also like making music! I am decent at playing piano and would like to learn guitar over the summer. I enjoy music because it is another form of self expression, and I just generally find joy from listening to it. It can be a mood booster or even help me focus.
